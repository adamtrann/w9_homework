        <h1>Visualisation of Australia's Highest Recorded Temperature</h1>
    </center>
    <h3>The domain of your visualisation</h3>
    <p>The domain of this visualisation pertains to climate, as I ultimately seek to explore its correlation with
        bushfires in the final assignment.</p>
    <h3>The visualised dataset (attribute types, source and author, etc.)</h3>
    <p>The content being visualised relates to the maximum temperature recorded in Australia.
    <p>
        The data was extracted from <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records.shtml" target="_blank">the
            Bureau of Meteorology</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Data transformation that you applied (if any), such as normalisation by area or population.</h3>
    <p>No data transformation as required</p>

    <h3>A justification for the type of map idiom used. For example, explain why you chose to create a proportional
        symbol map instead of a choropleth map or a dot map.</h3>
    <p>chose to visualize the highest temperature recorded for each state using a choropleth map because this method
        effectively highlights geographic differences in temperature. A choropleth map allows for a clear visual
        representation of data by filling regions with varying shades or colors based on their values, making it easy to
        compare temperatures across states at a glance.

        Using this medium, viewers can quickly identify which states experience the highest temperatures and observe
        patterns, such as clusters of higher temperatures or areas with more moderate climates. Additionally, choropleth
        maps can convey a sense of scale, allowing for easy interpretation of relative differences in temperature among
        the states.</p>
